This assumes you have a **[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)** sever.

## Create a Library:
Create a plex library (**TV Series**) for Floatplane and set these settings for it:

###  Posters:
There is a collection of posters you can download, you can find them **[Here](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/tree/master/artwork)**.<br>
Use these to set the artwork for each channel in plex if you dont want it to be blank.

### Optional Plex Addon (Open Folder/Play in MediaPlayer):

If you dont want to watch the Floatplane content in the plex player and just want to use it for browsing the library. Then you can install **[This Awesome Script](https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer)** to let you open the folder media is in and auto play plex files in your default media player.

More info on its install is  at the above link.<br>
